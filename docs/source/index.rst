Welcome to StudySync documentation.

StudySync is a collaborative web application designed to transform the way students connect, study, and succeed together. Unlike traditional ad hoc study groups or generic messaging platforms, StudySync provides a structured, scalable environment tailored specifically for academic collaboration. The platform makes it easy to find or create study groups based on courses, availability, and preferred study methods-removing the friction from group formation and scheduling.
